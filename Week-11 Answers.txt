1.) What process did you follow for creating the dockerfile?
      I followed the DockerHub info, which gave the needed template.


2.) What docker commands did you use to run the image?
      'sudo docker build -t flask-quickstart:latest .'
      'sudo docker run --name flask -p 5000:5000 flask:latest'

    -t was used for tag, so I didnt have to mess with the auto generated given id, which would have been a pain.
